TODO
----

 * Do some sort of nth-child calculation to get as specific a selector as possible.

 * Click on parts of a rule to show the target and source elements in above panes.
 
 * Load the jQuery and jQuery UI code from Google's CDN
   http://encosia.com/2009/10/11/do-you-know-about-this-undocumented-google-cdn-feature/
 
 * When the Children box is checked, highlight the element's children in the pane to  
   confirm that these elements are the ones you want to act on.
   
 * Make the preview tab a button, which when clicked opens up the Deliverance-themed
   site in a lightbox. Currently, with the preview as a tab that is loaded via
   Ajax, the other tabs disappear as soon as you start navigating the site.
   
 * Implement the rules table as a jqGrid - http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/
   Populate the table rows using the pre-defined rules in the rules.xml file.
 
 * Refresh button for panes

 * Highlight item or container after first item is selected, and grey out the rest of the screen.
    
 * Create some sort of drag-n-drop ui flow for rule creation.
    There is a way to do it between iframes using prototype:
    http://bluestudios.co.uk/blog/sandbox/iframe/iframe.html
    demo: http://bluestudios.co.uk/blog/sandbox/iframe/iframe.html
    (unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be a feature of jQuery yet.
    See http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/188706c9633b35f4)
    
 * Write rules to rules.xml file (the editing tool provided by Deliverance already does this so it might just be a matter of hooking into that.)
 
 * Dropdown for each pane with all ids for quick selection (provide quickjump to common elements in Plone that you want to insert into your theme)

 * For the file browser, provide a nicer looking directory tree:
    See http://www.webappers.com/2008/04/01/fully-interactive-jquery-file-tree/
    Also http://paulbakaus.com/lab/css/filemanager/
    
 * In the theme pane, provide a way to upload a new theme (HTML, CSS files) or point to a remote URL.
 
 * In the content pane, provide a way to point to a remote URL (i.e. not localhost)
 
 * In the theme pane, provide a pre-defined set of themes to choose from, with rules.xml files already created for each one.
